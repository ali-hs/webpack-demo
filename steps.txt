install webpack
npm install webpack -D

create structure of the app
app/
- index.js
- component.js
build/

to create a html template we can install html-web-pack plugin
npm instal html-webpack-plugin -D

create webpack.config.js

to run webpack easily, add it as npm script
"build": "webpack"

--------Automatic browser refresh on changes---------
install webpack dev server
npm install webpack-dev-server -D

add npm script in package.json to launch webpack dev server
"start": "webpack-dev-server --env development",
"build": "webpack --env production"

At this stage changes in code and save should auto refresh the app in the browser.

Changes in webapack.config.js requires to restart the dev server
To handle this case we can use nodemon plugin that watches for changes in this file and auto restart the webpack-dev-server
npm install nodemon -D
change the package.json and update "start" script in
"start": "nodemon --watch webpack.config.js --exec\"webpack-dev-server --env development\""
